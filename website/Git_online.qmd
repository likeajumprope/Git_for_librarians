Git is structured in *Repositories*.

The repositories on Github are divided in two types of repositories:

-   Those you have writing access to (your repositories)

-   Repositories of other people that you can only view

> Challenge: Log into your github account.

Log into your Github account.

1.  Find the place where your repositories (will) live.

2.  Search for other people's repositories.

While you don't have writing access to most repositories, they provide a great resource.

Other information that are revealed about the repositories are information such as the programming languages used (here: Ruby) and the number of *stars* the repositories has and the date the repository was last updated. You can star repositories that you like; they will appear in your profile under *your stars*.

> Challenge: Click on one of the repositories and have a look at the content!
