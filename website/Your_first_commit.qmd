## The Readme.md

We just created a README.md file when initializing your first repository.

The README.md is often **the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository**. README files typically include information on:

-   The purpose and content of the rpository

-   how to contribute to the repository (sometimes separated in a different file called Contributing.md)

The ending .md is an indicator of the Markdown language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The documents for this website are also written in Markdown.

Examples of the Markdown language:

## Headlines

The number of `#` determine the level of the headline:

    # A first level heading

    ## A second level heading

    ## A third level heading

# A first level heading

## A second level heading

### A third level heading

## Images

## Weblinks

You can learn about the markdown language [here at this official resource](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and at this [resource from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Commits on Github

## What is a commit

The contribution in Git is structured in commits. Commits are small, labeled changes to a file or item in a git repository. They can be seen as a snapshot of the state of repository at the time of the commit which can be reversed back to (in theory). They hence allow to create a *track record of changes of the repository over time*. Git will not allow any changes to documents or files without committing them first.

## Final remarks - committing

Always commit your changes! While changes might be saved by your operating system, git only tracks changes once they are committed.
