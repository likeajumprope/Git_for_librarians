CVCS, such as Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Subversion (SVN), were introduced. These systems had a central server that stored the repository and allowed multiple developers to access and commit changes. However, they still had some limitations, such as the reliance on a central server and the inability to work offline effectively.\nDistributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): DVCS addressed the limitations of CVCS by allowing developers to have local copies of the entire repository. One of the most prominent DVCS is Git, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git introduced a distributed architecture where each developer had a complete copy of the repository, including the entire history. This allowed for efficient branching, merging, and offline work. Other DVCS like Mercurial (Hg) also gained popularity.\nWeb-Based Version Control Systems: With the rise of the internet and collaborative development, web-based version control systems emerged.
