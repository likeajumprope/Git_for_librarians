-   Go to the repositories tab within your profile page and click the New button.

1.  Choose one of the ways just described to initialize a new repository.

2.  Name your repository - keep it short and precise, for example "My_first_repo" ( you might realize that Github also makes some more or less reasonable suggestions).
3.  Describe it (optional)
4.  Select *Public/Private*. If you have a free account, all your repositories will be public.
5.  Check the box to initialize your repository with a "Readme.md"
6.  Click *Create repository*

## Congratulations! You have created your first repository!
